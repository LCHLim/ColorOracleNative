# Technical User Guide (Installation)

## Installation and Configuration

The software’s installation process is easy and streamlined.

1.  Download the .zip file
2.  Extract the zip to a desired location
3.  Run the setup.exe file
4.  Choose install when prompted
    
The software does not need to be configured for Windows, and should run straight out of the box, after installation.

To uninstall the software, navigate to the Add Or Remove Programs section in the Windows Control Panel, select Color Oracle, and choose to remove.  

## Software Requirements
A relatively recent Windows Operating System should be used when running this software. Additionally, the .NET Library, version greater than 4, should be installed. On most Windows releases, this comes bundled with the OS installation.

## Hardware Requirements
The software should be able to run on any hardware that supports Windows. To ensure best performance, the following should be used or exceeded:

-   Processor: 1GHz
-   RAM: 2GB
-   Available Hard Drive Space: 100MB
-   Internet Connection: Advised but not required (used for external functionality)

## Limitations

Although there are few limitations that the end user will experience when using this software, we would like to mention two compromises that we have made that the end user may encounter when running the application:

1.  Global Keyboard Shortcuts cannot be toggled to an alternate set, unlike local keyboard shortcuts. This is due to the security issues inherent with logging more keys than needed on a global operating system level.
2.  An internet connection is required in order to send feedback to the development team, as well as access the external website and help pages. The software’s core functionality will run regardless of this, however.
