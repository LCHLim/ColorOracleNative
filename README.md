Note:
Although the code is provided under the MIT license, the real time color values are based on an approximation transformation matrix found at colorjack.org
It is important to note that these values are not as accurate as the screenshot method, due to the inherent problems with using only a single global transformation.
These differences are most notable to laypeople in the saturation of colors, and yellowness of whites.

We believe these values are intended to recreate the look of Matthew Wickline's algorithm for computing color vision deficiencies, which is free for non commercial use, here we attach the license for this work.
