# Basic End User Guide

Welcome to Color Oracle. This is a short introduction to the software, its featureset, and how to use it. Also available, is a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5dhUYKFQic) of the software, if you would like a more visual outline of the software.

## Main Window

When you start the software, you will be greeted with the window on the right. Here, you can access all the major functionality of the software.

  

Firstly, we can choose between the four color blindness types available by clicking on one of the four color coded icons. Then, you can choose between the two functionalities in the bottom right corner, either running the real time filter, or the screenshot. This is done by clicking on the respective button. Letâ€™s explore the screenshot button first.

## Screenshot

Upon clicking the screenshot button, you will have the opportunity to resize the desired screenshot by dragging the edges of the window, before clicking the capture button in the top left corner. The final image will be displayed in a new window. You then have the opportunity to save this to disk, by clicking the save button, which prompts you to choose a location to save to.

## Real Time Filter

After selecting the real time button, the filter should be instantly applied to the entire screen. This can be turned off by clicking the real time filter button again. Alternatively, you can now toggle between the different filter types by clicking a different one.

##### Note: The method that is used to create this filter is not as accurate as the screenshot method, which uses the best formulas in academia to simulate the deficiencies, and is instead meant to represent the difficulties people with color vision deficiencies face instead.

## Menu Bar

Within the menu bar in the top of the window, you have access to additional functionalities of the application.

  

Under File, you have access to the About page, which links to the website, email and source code of the application. The Send Feedback button takes you to a webpage where we encourage users to give us feedback regarding their use of the application. The help button will link to a video guide of the application.

  

Under Settings, you have the options to change the color blindness type, as well as learn about the respective keyboard shortcuts. These will work while the main window is opened. You can toggle to an alternate set of keyboard shortcuts. The shortcuts are as follows:

  

-   Ctrl + Q = Deuteranopia (Alt: Ctrl + V)
-   Ctrl + W = Protanopia  (Alt: Ctrl + B)
-   Ctrl + E = Tritanopia  (Alt: Ctrl + N)
-   Ctrl + R = Grayscale  (Alt: Ctrl + M)
  

  

Under Run, access to the two functions are available, being running the real time filter and screenshot. Additionally, the user has access to two global keyboard shortcuts, which will work regardless of what application is currently focused/opened. These are:

  

-   Ctrl + Shift + L = Run/Toggle Real Time Filter
-   Ctrl + Shift + M = Run Screenshot Filter
    

  

## TrayIcon

The application also opens up a TrayIcon, which runs persistently in the background (until closed). Here, you have access to the main functionality, being opening the main window again, running the real time filter, screenshot, and cycling the blindness type.

Here, the user has access to the original two global keyboard shortcuts outlined in Menu Bar, and additionally has access to Ctrl + Shift + N = Cycle Blindness Type.

## Closing the Application
Closing the main window will not close the application, as the application will run in the background using the TrayIcon functionality. Instead, to close the application, use the Exit button located in the TrayIcon.
